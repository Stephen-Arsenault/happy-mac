#Ordering
When ordering from JLCPCB, make sure you order this with a white PCB so that the silkscreen is black. You could use ENIG instead of HASL for a fancy gold colored pin.

You will also want to order the pins, personally I elected to [use magnets like these from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RWRVL39/).
